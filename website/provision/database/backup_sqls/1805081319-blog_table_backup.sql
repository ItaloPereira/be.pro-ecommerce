The temperature can reach an upwards of 30 degrees Celsius upon sunrise. Today at 05:15 AM we can read that it is almost 25 degrees Celsius. The air is full of moisture as the relative humidity is already at 100%. A dense fog is setting up with no wind so we will have to wait for the sun to dissipate all humidity. \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon our arrival in Trang Airport, it is difficult to have an exact idea of the horizontal visibility. (It is a major factor for us to plan a takeoff.) We need as a minimum 250 meters of visibility as JAA operator (EASA). In that case Low Visibility Procedures (LVP) must be in force or 400 meters without LVP. The Air Traffic Controller (ATC) is not really sure about the values of the day. No METAR in Trang. The air traffic controller on duty is doing his best to give us acceptable values. \\r\\n\\r\\nFog is a real threat for the takeoff, especially in case of a directional loss of control during the acceleration phase. This short time frame can represent a very hazardous situation, for example, in case of an engine failure. We have to make a decision for our departure and any big delays are not good for us today. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is once again a very long day of flying. \\\"Safety first,\\\" that is the pilot\'s motto. The only solution is to evaluate the horizontal visibility on our own. We need to measure the horizontal visibility and to check if it is compatible with our minimals. This measurement needs to be reliable and accurate. It is not really common but we will do a VIBAL. VIBAL stands for Visibilté Balise. In this procedure a human observer (or pilot in take-off position) determines the Runway Visual Range (RVR) by counting specific markers adjacent to the runway or by counting runway edge lights. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have a look on the Trang AIP you can see that the spacing between runway edge lights is 60 meters. By doing simple math, we need only to see five lights on each side of the runway as a minimum for our takeoff. After a quick inspection granted by the control tower, we are able to count more than 11 lights on each side. We are good to go! This procedure is not really common, it is only the second time for me in 10 years of flying. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe feeling to walk on taxiways and the runway with your high visibility yellow jacket and your handheld radio is really odd. Most of the time when a pilot lines up on a runway, it is to plan a takeoff. We are inspecting the site! No special delays forecasted today! Really good news! The flight from Trang to Phuket was a pure delight! FL150, with a very good visibility, nice cumulus clouds. Perfect lights and great landscapes. Phuket-Mangalore \\r\\n\\r\\n(VTSP-VOML) \\r\\nDist: 1453 Nm FLT: 03:36 12-04-17 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe turnaround in Phuket was long. Too long under a really hot sun and so much humidity, we are drenched. MJETS, our handling agents, are efficient, but the airport wants to have us on a stand with a pushback. After a 30 minute procedure to adapt our tow bar to the tug we are good to go to Mangalore India (VOML.) We were a little bit worried about this “home-made” pushback but ground staff was really cautious and the non-standard operation was smooth and easy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe flight plan is supposed to be filed at FL400 over the Bay of Bengal, which is the largest bay in the world. After a takeoff from RWY 09 in Phuket we are in Contact with the Bangkok FIR and then with Chennai FIR. This area is overcrowded. We are stuck at FL340 and we cannot obtain or even request our expected flight level. We are thinking about a diversion on the Indian east coast. Hopefully a lot of airports are accessible and can be used as alternates. (Chennai Intl, or Bengaluru...) \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again we are trying with Philippe to negotiate a higher cruising altitude. The area is a real mess, the L645 airways between SAPAM and DUBTA and the P574 between DUBTA and MMV are congested with a lot of traffic from the Arabic Gulf. From FL330 up to FL370 there are no windows to cross over and the weather is not good. Air liners are avoiding weather cells in almost every directions. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt 03:57 AM the ATC advised us to climb to FL430 and to be level before 04:08. No problem, we can make it. At FL430 our fuel consumption is 209 kgs/hour per engine against 260 kgs/hour per engine at FL 340. Fuel management on this world tour is a very, very time consuming mission and we understand clearly what it is to fly the aircraft up to the range edge. From the sky India is red, soil is full of oxidized iron. The rust contained in the soil provide this red color. Once again during a couple of seconds we are amazed by the spectrum of colors discovered during this Journey. Visibility was not the best with a small six kilometers of visibility obtained in a middle of a growing smog. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather was fine for an IFR activity. OAT 32 degrees Celsius and a 24 degrees Celsius Dew point. That is pretty humid but it is almost impossible to plan a visual approach due to the unknown area and the weather. The procedure is an ILS Z for RWY 24. The ATC in India is really succinct and understanding a simple clearance to reach the Initial Approach Fix is a real challenge for us. \\r\\n\\r\\nMangalore-Dubai (VOML-OMDW) \\r\\nDist: 1432 Nm FLT: 03:39 12-04-17\\r\\n\\r\\nThe turn-around was efficient with the airport staff well organized. The fuelling procedure was done by the book. The fuel supplier made some tests on samples collected in front of us to prove the good quality of the fuel. No humidity or sediment. I am amazed because I have only done this procedure once. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce in Abidjan, Africa and now once in Mangalore, India. The procedures are really well followed and once again it is great to feel on the safe side. Fuel is done, and our passports in our pockets. The flight is going to be long to Dubai Al Maktoum but the coasts of India, Pakistan, Iran and Oman will guide us up to the United Arab Emirates. \\r\\n\\r\\nFuel is not going to be an issue on this leg. Our flight planning tools and methods of management are great but are really time consuming as mentioned above on this World Tour. OE-GPL is on course, FL430. We have almost circumnavigate all the world at FL430! Upon our arrival in Al Maktoum, the weather is really nice but temperatures are hot. The air is dry! OAT: +40 degrees Celsius and DEW POINT: zero degrees Celsius. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is really hard for us to condition the aircraft for the overnight stop and we are really tired after an eight hour and ten minute of block time. Your sweat evaporates literally. The drive from Al Maktoum to downtown Dubai is a 45 minutes ride. I will see nothing through the window as I am already asleep. \\r\\n\\r\\nDubai-Hurghada (OMDW-HEGN) \\r\\nDist: 1304 Nm FLT: 03:54 14-04-17 \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the longest flight of our world tour from a time point of view. Our departure will be delayed a little bit due to work on RWY34L/16R in Hurghada, Egypt. The other RWY34R/16L is only available for government and military flights. In order to manage departures and arrivals to HEGN, Egyptians authorities decided to close the airfield for a two hour frame. Our departure from Al Maktoum will be planned accordingly. The airway distance is not a factor but we have to deal with a strong head wind all the way up to Hurghada. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are facing an average wind of 80 knots, in the final moments of this flight the wind will be stronger with a 123 knots value. On the route the weather seems to be pretty unstable below FL380, we can figure it out, by listening to our colleagues from other companies looking for options in order to avoid en-route weather. The approach in Hurghada is beautiful – the landscapes are breathtaking! The water of the Red Sea is showing us the best blue ever, turquoise! \\r\\n\\r\\nI can clearly understand why this place is one of the best place in the world for scuba-diving. Egyptian ATC allowed us to proceed for a great visual approach. Now on the ground it is time to perform our famous quick turnaround procedure. We are like a Formula 1 team on the pit stop! We know exactly how to proceed to save our precious time- brakes, oil, fuel, hydraulics, tires, and two or three signatures on local paperwork and good to go to Italy! \\r\\n\\r\\nHurghada-Taranto (HEGN-LIBG) \\r\\nDist: 1206 Nm FLT: 03:23 14-04-17 \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a 42 minute stop in Egypt it is time to takeoff for Europe. The departure was a little bit confusing as the airport staff had to provide us a new route on a last minute schedule. To be honest the new route was only known when reaching NABED to NOZ. That was a real mess to join the new one. Everybody was surprised - CREW and ATC. Upon the arrival in LIBG, Taranto there was only one big towering cumulus, and it was just on our path to reach the final for RWY 35 in Taranto. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are always a little bit surprised about Taranto. It\'s pretty hard to spot the airfield in the area. I don\'t know if it is the local landscape of this area or the ambient light but it is not a piece of cake to recognize the field. The turn-around will be mastered as usual. Now we want to go home. The aircraft is behaving great for this final day. The LIBG field is a great one for fuel stops, as most of the secondary airports Taranto, it is really well equipped. \\r\\n\\r\\nHandling is efficient, they work a lot with large freighters such as the Boeing 747 Large Cargo Freighter, the Dreamlifter. Alenia Aeronautica produces big fuselage parts of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in a hangar located beside airport\'s apron. The Boeing Monster Cargo plane, several times a month, is tasked with carrying the parts and to fly them to the Boeing factory at Paine Field and Boeing South Carolina at Charleston International Airport. Our Italian stop is now over. \\r\\n\\r\\nTaranto-Paris Le Bourget (LIBG-LFPB) \\r\\nDist: 840 Nm FLT: 02:26 14-04-17 \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are going to come back to Paris right on time with our schedule! What an adventure... we can feel a kind of nostalgia. Call signs on the frequency are not exotic anymore, we are back in our area of operation. On this final day we spend 10-hours-and-12-minutes working in the flight desk. We were really happy when reaching Advanced Air Support Paris Le Bourget base in H5 to see familiar faces. We will need several days to cope with this feeling and jet lag. We are so proud about our great adventure. Here are some figures compiled during this unique experience!

The common name of the Bauhinia is the Hong Kong Orchid Tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stayed in the Sheung Wan area of Hong Kong. The hotels are nice and comfortable. You can obtain a room with a great view facing the main entry of the busy Victoria Harbour just in front of Tim Sha Tsui very urbanized place.

Similar to our aircraft, the AW139 is equipped with two engines from Pratt & Whitney. The turbine used to power the Agusta AW-139 is the PT6. It is popular in the world of choppers and turboprops. A very reliable engine with easy maintenance processes is a key to a commercial success.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur tourist activities were interrupted by our departure management to Phuket, Thailand.The slots management in Hong Kong is really a matter of patience and, sometimes, frustrations.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe complication does not come from Phuket Thailand, but from Hong Kong. A few slots are allocated per day in VHHH and you have to be able to make it within a plus-or-minus a two hour window.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a 14:10 UTC departure slot time in VHHH you can expect to be airborne between 12:10 UTC up to 16:10 UTC. In local time it corresponds to 20:10 up to 00:10. The trip to Thailand will require a 03:30 flight time. In Thailand you cannot obtain overnight parking in Phuket (VTSP) for private jets, so we have to position the aircraft in Trang (VTST) after dropping our passengers in Phuket. Trang airport is open only from 2300 to 1230 UTC. We will probably have to land in Phuket at 15:40 UTC because of the slot in Hong Kong and with a one hour turnaround we won\'t be able to go to Trang before the next day! However maximum parking time in Phuket is 03:00 of occupancy. We will need more than 04:30 of parking time in Phuket to be able to take off to Trang. At this precise moment we were not sure that our handling agent was able to negotiate a waiver to extend our stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can now understand how the situation can be tricky and demands a lot from the crew! \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have spent almost a whole day before our departure with Philippe to find solutions to either obtain a better slot, a waiver from Hong Kong airport, or to reconsider our schedule in Thailand. None of our attempts were successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlots in Hong Kong are managed like slots in Geneva through a web portal. You will need to pay between the equivalent of 400$ (US) to 1000$ (US) depending on the services provided through your subscription. With a login and a password you will be able to surf on this web page for ages in the hope of catching a better schedule. On web portals for major international airports, slots allocation and management are really good businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever mind, we will adapt ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a kind of view that you can obtain on the OCS website:\\r\\n\\r\\nimage{{IMAGE_PATH}}\\r\\n\\r\\nRed means nothing available.\\r\\nYellow means one slot available in a one hour period.\\r\\nGreen Two slots available in a one hour period.\\r\\nThis coding is displayed on a 24-hour period and is used for departures and arrivals. \\r\\n\\r\\nEven without being familiar with slots management you can easily understand the problem for our trip to Thailand. A lot of red on that picture...\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now faced with the only option available - leaving Hong Kong at 20:10 LT and perform a positioning on Trang airport the next day!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were into the flight preparation with Philippe. Flying in this part of the world is problematic when you are not familiar with the local procedures. We had to study our flight package and go deep into the details.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had to check our Jeppesen manuals, the state rules, and procedure for Hong Kong, China, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand. The flight package was huge, with a lot of NOTAMS. You have to sort and to synthesize this quantity of information and keep it relevant for your flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nReference pages in Hong Kong were also studied during a long period of time, we need to perform that in order to be more familiar with such a big and unusual airport for a bizjet like our Phenom 300. This kind of operation is so far away from our daily operations in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nReduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) (RVSM increases the number of aircraft that can safely fly in a particular volume of airspace) is also a concern in Asia, because China, for example, works with the measurement of altitudes, elevations, and heights in meters. Republic of China implemented metric RVSM on November 2007, but the Hong Kong Flight Information Region (FIR) continued to use flight levels in feet. Air Traffic Control is trying to facilitate your work by giving you the correct reference depending on which direction you are going to. A certain \\\"Confucianism\\\" feel. Within Chinese RVSM, Air Traffic Control (ATC) instructions will be given to the crew in meters since they adopted the metric RVSM, and then a conversion chart must be used to keep the altimeter readout in feet. That is not easy and it can lead to wrong spacing between aircraft in this area.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo end with this really \\\"pilot\'s stuff\\\" discussion, \\\"To fly in China metric Airspace, you have to fly in feet!\\\" It means, to maintain in China on a westbound track of 11.000 m level you have to be level off at FL341. It is because the metric RVSM table differs from a 100 feet from the classical RVSM table.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fuel was a hot topic again. Due to the hot temperatures in Hong Kong the fuel uplift quantity was 2,355 kg instead of 2,450 kgs. It means a loss of 95 kg that you won\'t be able to use inflight. It is a shame because it represents 15 minutes of holding time upon destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaxi time is long in Hong Kong and even when being punctual you can expect up to 30 minutes of delay at holding point. With engine setting on idle the fuel consumption is roughly 220 kg for both engines per hour 110 kg are now missing because of a prolonged waiting time on holding point for RWY 25L.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legal mini fuel for our flight from Hong Kong to Phuket is 2,185 kgs. We were taking off with 2,255 kg, which means a 70 kg of difference. It represents 10 minutes of holding time in Phuket. It is not a lot, but we were still on the safe side. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again we managed to negotiate a higher flight level for our cruising altitude with Philippe in order to have precious amount of fuel left upon destination. We were able to obtain FL430 instead of the FL370 as mentioned on our flight plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe departure was also a little bit disturbed by a BATT EXCEEDANCE CAS message on our respective PFD\'s. This is a yellow CAS (CREW Alerting System) flashing on our Primary Flight Displays (PFD). It does not require immediate action from the crew. It is an abnormal operational or airplane system conditions that require immediate crew awareness and a subsequent corrective or compensatory vrew action. (For Your Information a RED CAS message indicates an emergency that requires immediate corrective or compensatory crew action.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe annoying matter with the BATT EXCEEDDANCE CAS message can lead you in a situation where you have to first land as soon as possible and if it doesn\'t improve, land as soon as possible with an electrical emergency.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy sticking to the procedure on our QRH (Quick Reference Handbook), we managed to get rid of the Yellow CAS message and we were able to continue the flight to Thailand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night is a great time to fly. On that evening we had a great moon and a clear sky on two-thirds of the flight plan route.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were surprised about the fishing activity on the East China Sea between Hainan Island and Vietnam. A lot of lights were spread along on the sea. So peaceful to overfly Vietnam, Cambodia, then Gulf of Thailand. The atmosphere is quiet- less communications, and less activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrival in Thailand was not so calm. Thunderstorms were spotted on our radar in the Surat Thani, Phangnga, Phuket and Krabi areas. The advantage during night flight when thunderstorms are generated by isolated CBs, comes from the fact that it is really easy to spot a danger area by looking for lightning outside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CBs or TCUs (cumulonimbus or towering cumulus) were not too high. The average vertical development was from 2,000 feet up to FL290. The air was not too turbulent but the electrical activity was pretty strong. The last thing we need is to be struck by a lightning. We were starting a cat-and-mouse game with our weather radar and areas of strong precipitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you look closer at the aircraft radar printout on the area map, it is pretty easy to understand that all the Andaman Sea was under big adverse weather activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter having done our slalom between the storm cells, Philippe and I were really happy to land under the torrential rain in Phuket! That was impossible to intercept the ILS from the south.\\r\\nWe had to overfly the airfield and then intercept by the north. A huge cell was in fact between Phuket Island and Ko Yao Yai.\\r\\n\\r\\nimage{{IMAGE_PATH}}\\r\\n\\r\\nOur handling agents from MJETS managed to negotiate with Phuket Airport more than three hours of parking! We won\'t have to go once again into this adverse weather during night time and we will also have some rest after a very demanding flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next takeoff for Trang would be done under day light after a short night but full of sleep and rest...\\r\\n\\r\\nVTSP-VTST (Phuket-Trang) Distance 120 NM \\r\\nFLT: 00:23 \\r\\n\\r\\nAt least this flight was a reward from the previous night.\\r\\n\\r\\nBright sun, blue sky, marvelous islands everywhere, not too high cruising altitude, perfect conditions for sightseeing over Thailand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pictures are great.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s have some rest in Trang before our way back to Europe via India, United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Italy.\\r\\n\"}}}',NULL,'2018-01-15 18:10:10','2018-03-29 16:05:31'),(906,908,'[\"en\"]','2017-04-10 18:10:00',0,'{\"date\": \"10/04/2017 18:10\", \"role\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Pilot\"}}, \"image\": {\"url\": \"https://daflwcl3bnxyt.cloudfront.net/m/7ef9ea7600f83368/original/03.jpg\", \"bynderId\": \"283E843E-D901-4701-96F4B6708839594C\"}, \"title\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"The fascinating culture of Japan\"}}, \"author\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Nicolas Barbé\"}}, \"avatar\": {\"url\": \"\", \"bynderId\": \"\"}, \"content\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Flight RJNA-RJFK: (Nagoya-Kagoshima) \\r\\nFLT: 1:10 Distance: 395 nm. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent several days in Japan and we were very lucky to travel to this country. We visited Tokyo, Kyoto and Nagoya. We left the Phenom 300 at the Nagoya Airport. (RJNA/NKM) There are two airports in Nagoya. The \\\"big one,\\\" Nagoya RJGG/NGO, is the international airport. The other airport, RJNA Komaki used to be the international airport, but nowadays it is used as the secondary domestic airport. \\r\\n\\r\\nNagoya RJNA is a very good airport for general aviation. General Aviation in Japan is not as developed as it is in Europe. There are not many private aircraft flying over there. Japanese aviation enthusiasts fly single or twin-engine pistons aircraft. The market of the very light lets and other small turboprops is not that big in this part of the world. The handling team over there was so kind and so helpful. Misao \\\"Mickey\\\" Nagae is the manager of Nakanihon Air Service Co.,LTD. His team is always smiling and ready to help you. As I already mentioned, you can’t imagine how sometimes you feel lonely on the other side of the world even when working as a crew like we do with Philippe. Help on the ground, especially provided by people who know well aviation specific areas of operations, is always welcomed. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur workload and schedule can be very heavy. The aircraft, as means of transportation, was not used to travel inside Japan. The railway network is really efficient and reliable. We were travelling in Japan on board the Shinkansen trains. Compared with air transport, the Shinkansen has several advantages, including scheduling frequency and flexibility, reliable and on-time operation, comfortable seats, and convenient city-center. It is very easy to use the \\\"Rails\\\" in Japan. Metro and trains are really easy to book and it is not a big issue to find your way because the signage and information is always available in English as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese, just like Chinese writing, is full of exoticism, especially for those using a \\\"cold\\\" writing system such as the Latin alphabet. If you want to dig a little bit further, modern Japanese is written in a mixture of three main systems: kanji, characters of Chinese origin used to represent both Chinese loanwords into Japanese and a number of native Japanese morphemes; and two syllabaries: hiragana and katakana. I don\'t want to go too deep into this issue, because it will take us too far from our human experience and our great flying adventure onboard the Phenom 300. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a very useful app for smartphone that can help you to find your way in the Tokyo metro. As an example, if you want to go from your hotel in Idabashi to the fish market in Tsukiji, you will have to use the blue line from T06 to T11 (Kayabacho), then the grey line from Kayabacho to Tsukiji (H12-H10). This ride will take eighteen minutes and it will cost you around 170 Yen. The app will also provide you the exits for the Tsukiji Market. It will be exit 1 or 2. As you can see, really simple! I recommend this app to travelers who want to use the metro in Japan and to visit main spots of interest. Everybody knows time is a precious asset for pilots. So good tips and advice about how to perform a task quickly are always welcomes! \\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese are really kind, they will help you all the time. In Japanese culture it is very hard to say no, and sometimes when you are lost it can become a little bit complicated to ask about how to get to a destination. Because if the person you are asking for directions doesn\'t know the way, it can turn into a very funny situation. They will do their best to guide you even if that means arriving late at work or for an appointment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe life rhythm is really fast-paced. People are running everywhere, sometimes it is even a little bit robotic, making lines everywhere. Discipline and rigor are omnipresent. Tasks are performed automatically in a very robotic way. A lot of manpower to provide basic tasks, such as train cleaning or so, is done in town by seniors. I don\'t know what the employment rate is, but it seems to be good. The Japanese have a really strong personal interest in their jobs. You can’t compare their attitude towards work with ours in Europe. \\r\\n\\r\\nHyper high-frequency noises and light aggressions come from everywhere. Advertisements are really intrusive and everywhere, Japanese modern music is played a lot in public or private places and pretty loud. It is not easy to get a good rest. In fact, I now understand why Japanese pay so much attention toward the so-called: \\\"Zen\\\" attitude. They need to get rid of all stresses and tensions. Massages, sports, Japanese gardens or even the tea ceremony are here to reduce the stress level. \\r\\n\\r\\nFood in Asia, not only in Japan, is great and pretty healthy. It will be another story on the Chinese side, but in Japan we had the pleasure of eating well. If you love fish and sea food, you have to go to the Tsukiji fish market. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuckily, our stop in Japan coincided with the cherry blossom. There are several blooming trees, in particular the Japanese cherry, which is called Sakura in Japanese. To be honest, even if you are not into gardening, you have to see the cherry blossoms. The time frame to observe this phenomena is really narrow. The cherry blossoms in Japan are so important, that every year the Japanese Meteorological Agency and the public track the Sakura zensen (Cherry blossom front) as it moves northward up the archipelago with the approach of warmer weather via nightly forecasts following the weather segment of news programs. The blossoming begins in Okinawa in January and typically reaches Kyoto and Tokyo at the end of March or the beginning of April. That experience in Japan was really interesting. \\r\\n\\r\\nLifestyle over there is really different from what we know. Learning about these different cultures is another reason why I have this job: curiosity about other cultures and discovering new things every day. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust as the Japanese life, our flight preparation to Hong Kong was really stressful and full of unscheduled surprises. The main issue are the slots in Hong Kong. I will talk about that later on. From now, you have to keep in mind that slots are rare and the timeframes are really narrow. So when planning a two-leg trip with a fuel stop in Kagoshima (RJFK/KOJ) and two customs checks, one in Nagoya and one in Kagoshima, plus an one hour and twenty minutes trip from Nagoya to Kagoshima, and a three hours and forty minutes leg from Kagoshima to Hongkong, things are becoming a true nightmare. First of all, our slot in Hong Kong forced us to plan our takeoff from Nagoya two hours ahead of our schedule. (07:00 LT instead of 09:00 LT) The problem is customs are not open until 08:30 LT!!!! We tried to request waivers or to obtain a tailored customs check, but it was impossible. It is also part of the culture, you follow the line/process and stick with it. In my culture, we follow the line/process, but also look for exceptions when needed. \\r\\n\\r\\nBe careful even if you are planning to depart from a non-airport of entry in Japan. You have to wait for customs and immigration. As general aviation is not common, you have to be careful in case of an early morning departure and check the fuel truck availability. Only two slots were available 05:40 LT and 08:00 LT. The fuel trucks on an airfield like Nagoya are really busy supporting local companies for morning departures. We were supposed to depart at 07:00, so 05:40 was the best option! Really early wake up time indeed, 04:00 LT without breakfast! Breakfast solution was well managed from Nakanihon Air Service. Mickey and his great team provided me with a great breakfast, including a real cappuccino and banana cakes! They also provided us a briefing from a pilot based at the Nagoya Airport. Amazing, just like at major airlines with dispatch service, the pilot provides us information regarding special NOTAMs (notice to airmen) on the airfield and weather information upon departure and en-route. After flying for 16 years it is the first time another pilot is providing the crew a tailored departure briefing! Well done guys and keep on going that!!!! \\r\\n\\r\\nAt least we managed to leave Nagoya with 01:40 minutes of delay. We have to be really efficient in Kagoshima to cope with our heavy schedule delay. The flight from Nagoya to Kagoshima was standard, weather was fine as usual at FL430. The sun on our faces and the nice purring of the Pratt and Whitney Canada engines, inspired us to take a nap... No way! We were too busy with Philippe sharpening our fuel management and planning a strategy on the Kagoshima-Hongkong leg. \\r\\n\\r\\nILS 34 in Kagoshima. Weather was very grey with many low clouds and moisture. Kagoshima airport is situated in the northern area of Kirishima next to Kagoshima bay. This bay looks like almost a closed sea. This is a consequence of the former volcanic activity done by volcanos: Mt Sakurajima and Mt Ontake. The Sakurajima volcano is the most active volcano in Japan. The meaning of its name is Cherry Blossom Island. The lava flows during the 1914 eruption caused the former island to be connected to the Osumi Peninsula. When performing your T.E.M (Threat and Error Management) briefing in such remote areas, you have to consider this seismic activity and you have also to consult carefully the Ashtams (The name ASHTAMS is an acronyms derived from NOTAMs). These items are the main part of your inactive threat, but it can happen without prior notice. We still remember our earthquake adventure in Magadan. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur Phenom 300 on gate 2, next to P4. We were now running to cope with our delay. Philippe and I are like a Formula One mechanic crew. The expected turnaround time was one hour, we\'ve managed to do it in 35 minutes block off to block on... That is a shame and a little bit frustrating, because without, once again, a control from customs and immigrations, including signatures from at least a dozen GENDECS, we would have been able to make it in 20 Minutes. Never mind one hour of delay would be expected to land in Hong Kong... let\'s keep our fingers crossed. We do not know how Chinese authorities react to these kinds of situations. \\r\\n\\r\\nLEG 2: Kagoshima-Hongkong (RJFK-VHHH)\\r\\nDistance: 1,132 NM FLT: 03:40 \\r\\n\\r\\nThe reasons for a stop in Kagoshima were simple:\\r\\n\\r\\nNagoya is not a direct airport of entry (it can be under certain circumstances but it is complicated to obtain screening medical services mandatory to enter in Japan), so you have to stop at an airport of entry to be clear from Japan. \\r\\nThe leg Nagoya-Hongkong is a 1,431 nm Great Circle distance. Roughly, as a rule of thumb, you have to add 10% to obtain your Airway distance which leads you to 1,574 nm. We are almost at the comfortable limit of the Phenom 300. \\r\\nWhen talking about \\\"comfortable limits,\\\" I am referring to fuel reserves. With the daily weather conditions we can plan the Nagoya – Hong Kong flight with fuel to proceed to Hong Kong and then Macao as an alternate (VMMC). The problem is in Hong Kong. You have to anticipate holding delays, it can be broadcast in the ATIS to expect up to thirty minutes delay sometimes or even more overhead \\\"ABBEY\\\" IFR Waypoint. When you need 30 minutes with a Phenom to hold you have to plan roughly 200 kg of fuel. (Another rule of thumbs is to consider 6.5 kg per minute.) That is the reason why we had to stop in Kagoshima. Our fuel reserves prior to arrival in Hong Kong had to be least 560 kg. You have to double your final reserve (200 kg times two) to absorb highly probable delays when reaching ABBEY and then add your alternate reserve. (160 kg to reach Macao). \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again the Flight conditions were really nice. The airspace in this part of Asia is overcrowded. During most of the flight time, we used our G1000 PFD Inset map windows, which showed heavy traffic nearby. The fatigue was present and the early start of the day, plus the stressful speedy turnaround in Kagoshima, were starting to affect us. Luckily, for our situational awareness and fatigue management, the Phenom 300 gives you significant useful tools to maintain this fatigue levels in a very manageable intensity. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs on the flight from Nome to Magadan, Philippe and I were really focused on our inflight fuel management. The figures were really nice, even after reaching FL 430 in forty minutes due to the high congestion airspace in Kagoshima area. On the first fuel check, the acceptable holding time overhead ABBEY was above 40 minutes. The arrival was done, as briefed, on ABBEY 2B RNAV arrival with a ILS RWY 07 L from LIMES. \\r\\n\\r\\nUsually, taxi at such a big airport is a little bit tricky. On the VLJ\'s (Very Light Jet) the crew position is really too low in comparison with other big jets. Most of the time on a conventional medium jet, range from cockpit window down to the ground varies from 4.5 to 6.5 meters. It is easy to spot and track your way on a wide spread markings environment, such as big international airports. Regarding the Phenom and other VLJ\'s, it is another matter. Pilots line of sight is only at a 1 or 2 meters height maximum above the ground and you have a very compacted view effect. You have to request progressive taxi and be very aware of your final destination on ground and by the same time to catch the right taxiway lines. Luckily, a friend of ours, Quentin, who works in Hong Kong, was able to give us many tips to be proactive on the ground movement at the airport in Hong Kong. Many thanks to his precious help and tips during our Hong Kong stop. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe left the Phenom 300 on the Signature Flight Support FBO Apron for three days. Once again, we obtained a very warm welcome from HKBAC Signature. They are not used to assisting the Phenoms. Ground handling agents were really amazed and surprised about the way we disconnect the compass on the nose land gear to be able to tow the aircraft. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s have a good rest in Hong Kong and visit a little bit this amazing city, before leaving a predicted challenge with the departure slots and our flight plans to Thailand...\"}}}',NULL,'2018-01-15 18:11:43','2018-03-29 16:05:31'),(907,908,'[\"en\"]','2017-03-29 18:26:00',0,'{\"date\": \"29/03/2017 18:26\", \"role\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Pilot\"}}, \"image\": {\"url\": \"https://daflwcl3bnxyt.cloudfront.net/m/431a41ce675647d9/original/04.jpg\", \"bynderId\": \"1D58C927-1042-4901-9D39A2CA450DF402\"}, \"title\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Day Four: Crossing Time\"}}, \"author\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Nicolas Barbé\"}}, \"avatar\": {\"url\": \"\", \"bynderId\": \"\"}, \"content\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Day 4: Nome, Alaska to Magadan, Russia (PAOM-UHMM) \\r\\n1272 nm\\r\\nFlight time 03:45\\r\\n\\r\\nFuel is a challenge today, we can’t land with less than 820 kgs of fuel, we need 195 kgs for our final reserve and 625 kgs to reach Petropavlovsk. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor this reason, we have to alter the cruise profile. We changed our MSC (Maximum Speed Cruise setting) to LRC (Long Range Cruise setting). We were glad to choose this option as the forecasted wind was stronger. Thanks to Philippe, it was a wise choice which was very well anticipated during our early morning meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine the Nome to Petropavlovsk flight, could have been fine in LRC, but there would have been no way to switch on a lower speed setting to save fuel upon arrival. Our decision was the right one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather in Magadan is once again beautiful and we requested to perform a visual approach for RWY 28 instead of 10. The runway was 3.5 kilometers long and the wind was less than 10 meters per second. In a very pleasant way we received from the Magadan ATC a \\\"Negative, full IFR procedure for RWY 10.\\\" Never mind. We will perform a lot of visual approaches up to our final destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the landing in Magadan, we are happy and surprised to see our welcome committee: customs, handlers and police. The Russians are very efficient with the customs. A seaport and industrial city, Magadan is located 435 km east of the town of Okhotsk. It lies on Nagayevo Bay, on the Sea of Okhotsk, on a narrow coastal plain backed by the Kolyma Range.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a weird feeling to lose a day. That is what happens when you cross the International Date Line. We took off from Nome, Alaska on March 28th and landed in Magadan, Russia on March 29th after a three-hour and forty five minute flight that same day. The Aircraft tech log is filled on the 29th and the weather forecasts are referring to weather on the 30th which is going to be a real brain teaser for the flight ops department.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are all extremely tired. The 40-minute ride in the cab to the restaurant was rather quiet because everyone is sleeping. \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the meal, my Embraer friend Tim Epping tells us about an earthquake (6.6  magnitude) that just happened, Sunday in Petropavlovsk, about 59 miles from our destination. Everybody was anxious because Petropavlovsk was our plan A. We trust that everything is fine now.  Luck was really on our side today and we hope it will continue for tomorrow.  After our burgers and a walk, we are ready to go to sleep. Tomorrow we reach Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nDay 4: Magadan, Russia to Sapporo Japan (UHMM-RJCC) \\r\\n1157 nm\\r\\n\\r\\nMegadan. Honestly, before we came here I had never heard of this Russian City. Only Willy from Speedwings, who loves Russian literature, was able to give me information about this city.  He mentioned a book “The Kolyma Tales”,  by Varlam Shalmamov (I never heard of him either).  Now I know what ops are doing in the middle of the night when our aircraft are circling the world.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe land in Magaden because our world tour objective is to be cost-effective and save time on the ground.  Philippe and our operations crew have tried to select airports with good ground support and facilities that are not too busy. Megadan is supposed to be relatively cheap and it has all the services you need when supporting such an usual trip. We call Megadan the “secondary airport.” \\r\\n\\r\\nTo get to the city of Magadan from the airport, a taxi is the safest way to get around, but the taxi drivers like to jump on the brake pedals which will jolt you into attention. From the drive, you can admire the Taiga, also called the boreal forest.  Taiga in Russian means: \\\"The land of the little sticks.\\\" This word comes from the shape of the trees. In this part of Siberia, most of the countryside is Taiga and Tundra.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing in Magadan  is like being in a flashback fifty years ago. Housing conditions are dilapidated and life is rough. I believe that is not great fun to live there every day. Mother Nature and the city’s history have taken their toll on this area. English is not commonly used here and you need a translator for every task, except possibly ordering dinner. Thanks to our lovely translator from Sreamline ops, we were able to get around.  She was so helpful with custom agents and hotel front-desk. Taking photos of the restricted area by the airport is impossible and strictly forbidden. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe city is a port town located on the Sea of Okhotsk. It is a gateway to the Kolyma region. The population reaches almost 96,000. This city was a major transit center for prisoners sent to labor camps. The town later served as a port for exporting gold and other metals mined in the Kolyma region. The principal sources of income for the local economy are still gold mining and fisheries. The city also has pasta and sausage plants as well as a distillery. A sample of the sausage was in our breakfast, which was served very early in our tiny hotel rooms. People here are quite helpful and they do their best to accommodate your needs during your stay, even though they are economically challenged.\\r\\n\\r\\nNight is going well until we are disturbed by the phone calls from Europe regarding the recent seismic activity in the Kamchatka area and our flight planning. The last minute change from Anadyr to Nome is still having repercussions on our trip schedule and organization.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe study the NOTAMS (Notice to Airmen) to alert pilots of hazardous conditions on the ride from the airport. We find out that two volcanos, Klyuchevskoy and Kamblany, have erupted last night which is also linked to the earthquake in Petropavlovsk (6.6 on the Richter scale). \\r\\n\\r\\nLast night at 5:09 p.m. on March 29,  a 6.6 earthquake struck Eastern Russia along the Kamchatka Peninsula. Fortunately, this region is sparsely populated and only one person registered feeling the quake on the USGS (United States Geological Survey). According to the USGS, the quake, which occurred at a depth of 22 km, involved severe shaking at the epicenter and a tsunami warning was briefly issued. So far there are no reports of damage or fatalities.  In addition to active volcanism on the Kamchatka Peninsula, the region is also one the most seismically active places on earth. Here is an excerpt of the actual warning as we are told that we are in an emergency stage orange. Flight crews are required to exercise caution due to volcanic ash clouds.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the extract of one of the two NOTAMS for the area:\\r\\n\\r\\nP1206/17 - VOLCANO KLYUCHEVSKOY 300260 5603N16039E (RUSSIA, KAMCHATKA) IN ACTIVE STAGE. EMERGENCY STAGE CODE: ORANGE. AIR TRAFFIC DIFFICULT WI THIS AREA DUE TO DANGEROUS ERUPTION OF VOLCANIC ASH. FLIGHT CREWS ARE REQUIRED TO EXERCISE CAUTION AND PRUDENCE, INDEPENDENTLY ESTIMATE POSSIBILITY OF FLT WI THIS AREA, MAINTAIN WATCH FOR SIGMET,NOTAM, AIREP FOR AREA REFERRED TO ABOVE. PILOTS FLYING IN VOLCANIC ASH CLOUD AREA AND ENCOUNTERING DIFFICULTIES IN CONTINUING FLIGHT MUST REPORT TO ATC UNIT IMMEDIATELY. SFC - FL270, 28 MAR 09:25 2017 UNTIL 27 APR 09:00 2017 ESTIMATED. CREATED: 28 MAR 10:02 2017 \\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a map of the seismic area:\\r\\n\\r\\nimage{{IMAGE_PATH}}\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be honest in our European culture volcanos are not friendly. The threat and destruction incurred by the volcano Eyjafjallajökull, in Iceland on March 20, 2010 is still fresh on our minds. Our crew knows what kind of approach to use as well as the consequences of this volcanic activity. Thank God, the Petropavlovsk option was not our Plan A yesterday! Imagine spending the night in Petropavlovsk, waiting for secondary aftershock quakes or even bigger ones. That is the definition of a waking nightmare.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main threat for our aircraft is going to be the ash cloud. It can cause severe damage to different parts of the vessel: engine malfunction (the silicate ashes melt in the hot section of the turbine which can lead to discharge pressure and engine surge and a dual engine flame out), long term engine damage (due to the abrasive effect of volcanic ash particles), and external surface corrosion (ashes can cause significant damages to the exposed surfaces). \\r\\n\\r\\nAt night, St Elmo\'s fire is created. The charged ash particles are colliding with the aircraft. It can be the first indication that we are flying into a dense volcanic ash. As in Iceland, one of the clues to spot an ash cloud is the smell of sulfur in the aircraft cabin. Hopefully, the ash cloud is too recent and not spread out enough to affect our path in the low layers. \\r\\n\\r\\nEven in the case of an engine loss, our drift down procedures give us a recovery altitude on reaching FL 270 for a 7200 kgs aircraft weight in ISA - 10° C. It is roughly the figures of today\'s flight. That means after almost one hour of flight, if we do encounter an engine failure, we will descend from FL430 to FL270 at the drift down speed and we will be able to maintain this altitude, even if one engine is inoperative. Thanks to Embraer and Pratt and Whitney, we are reassured that we can rely on such performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlying in Russia is also an occasion to fly with different measurement units. It is known to be the country of heights given in meters below transition level and wind in meters per seconds.\\r\\nThat means we are not working in altitude. The altimeter setting will not be the sea level pressure (QNH), but the pressure measured on the airport surface (QFE). Magadan area is surrounded by mountainous terrain all around, so in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) you have to be careful especially if you are not familiar with the following settings and if you do not have an easy means to convert feet to  meters and vice-versa. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phenom 300 is really well-advanced and the Garmin 1000 avionic suite is able to display meters and feet on your altitude tape in your PFD without doing any conversions at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of Flight OPS departments and pilots prefer to work in QNH even in Russia. Personally, I don\'t like environments with different altimeter settings. Pilots and ATCs can fail to set the correct one. If everybody works with the same reference, it is easier to keep good situational awareness. As my mum would say, \\\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do!\\\" We operate with our Phenom fleet only twice a year and the crew is focused on these matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nHopefully after becoming airborne we will be cleared rapidly to FL 270.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flight conditions to Sapporo are good, after almost four days of flying in remote places, Philippe and I are now rusty for flying in high density traffic areas. You can’t imagine the surprise upon our arrival in Sapporo and the huge workload from FL180 to the ground. The Japanese-English accent is a little bit surprising if you are not used to it. The airport is saturated and overcrowded.\\r\\n\\r\\nLanding in Sapporo was a good experience. Snow and rain showers with temperatures around 5° Celsius are here to welcome us. Engine and wing anti-ice were turned on during the approach sequence. The runways are long and grooved, which is good because it can be considered dry even when water or humidity is present. \\r\\n\\r\\nTaxing to apron K was pretty easy after our landing on RWY 19L, but later on it will lead us to a tricky situation with our avionics.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the arrival, the committee was here to welcome us.  Before leaving the aircraft, medical services has to measure our body temperature with an infrared thermometer machine to detect fevers. This situation is not cool because it can send you in a quarantine status, which is not the best way to spend time in Japan. Hopefully the three of us are in good condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nimage{{IMAGE_PATH}}\\r\\n\\r\\n​Bullet trains, planes and automobiles\\r\\nRJCC-RJNA (Sapporo, New-Chitose - Nagoya) \\r\\nFLT: 01:35 \\r\\nDistance: 550 nm\\r\\n\\r\\nQuick turnarounds are not always easy. Today, we are focused on dealing with customs, fuel, handlers and medical services. It is now time to leave for Nagoya and to set the flight plan in the G1000 FMS. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have set the flight plan without taking too much care to the first mentioned waypoint in my active flight plan. By habits the first point is always right unless the aircraft has been parked in a hangar with a GPS loss of integrity induced by a loss of signal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy displayed route was not a RJCC-RJNA route but a RJCJ-RJNA. Of course, I was not able spot the mistake the first time. I can assure you, that when you are not familiar with the area, it is hard react to this kind of issue. The SID\'s are different from CHITOSE to NEW CHITOSE. The GEFFY 2 RNAV departure was impossible to find and load. Good catch by Philippe. Even though he was exhausted, he managed to spot the mistake in the Flight Plan. That is the reason procedures, briefings and SOP\'s are so important. The two crew operations are a good thing on a complex and long trip. Because even when tired, you can correct a mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlying from New-Chitose to Nagoya was like flying in Europe. The flight \\\"rhythm\\\" is barely the same as the one you can find over there.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe landed in Nagoya over a densely populated area. The handling agents from Nakanihon Air Service Company, LTD, Eri and Mickey, were super friendly. It is always a good feeling to have welcoming and smiling people after a twenty-four-hour journey in 4 days. I do admire Japanese education and behavior; they are very organized and proactive. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you need to visit Tokyo for pleasure or business, our friend Thierry Pouille from Air Journey (www.airjourney.com), says it’s better to land in Nagoya so you can take a 01:40 minute ride on the great Shinkansen (Japanese bullet train). This train’s cockpit looks like that of a fighter jet. The Shinkansen is a high speed train that is famous throughout the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll our attention will now be focused on setting the aircraft for a five day break in Japan. The end of the day is beyond our physical limits: bus, train, and taxi all leading us to reach the great city of Tokyo, 3 hours after landing. Philippe, Patrick and I look like zombies. I was unable to get a lunch. Sushi is not going to be an option tonight.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy bed is my best friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will get some rest and we will keep you posted for the next legs of the \\r\\nColibri World Tour 2017.\\r\\n \\r\\nSafe travels,\"}}}',NULL,'2018-01-15 18:28:40','2018-03-29 16:05:31'),(908,908,'[\"en\"]','2017-03-28 18:28:00',0,'{\"date\": \"28/03/2017 18:28\", \"role\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Pilot\"}}, \"image\": {\"url\": \"https://daflwcl3bnxyt.cloudfront.net/m/4ad06b34666e27d6/original/05.jpg\", \"bynderId\": \"FE257D7C-BEBB-4AB1-929A4A3312C58C5F\"}, \"title\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Day Three: Frozen Ghost Towns, Great People and Walking on the Frozen Sea\"}}, \"author\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Nicolas Barbé\"}}, \"avatar\": {\"url\": \"\", \"bynderId\": \"\"}, \"content\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Day 3: Anchorage, Alaska to Nome, Alaska (PANC-PAOM)\\r\\n476 nm\\r\\nFlight time 01:20​\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a hard day flying, a full night of sleep is a relaxing treat. We are still suffering from jet lag and the circadian rhythm disturbance is something we need to manage in our “Threat and Error” management plan. We rise early but without the alarm clock. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe people at Signature Flight Support Anchorage are great: friendly and always ready to help us in our task.  We leave Anchorage, under a gray sky so as to reach Nome in less than an hour and a half.  The sky is now a gorgeous blue and the ground is covered with a blanket of snow. Alaska looks great from the air  as we cross the state on a northwest route. Landscapes look like a masterpiece of modern art.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather report in Nome is good: unlimited visibility, no clouds, and calm winds. The outside temperature is almost -20° Celsius upon our landing. Philippe has performed a visual approach for runway 28. During winter, the visual approach is confusing because you can’t distinguish the land from the sea. The Bering Sea is totally iced and covered with a layer of snow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landing is performed on this ice desert with great light provided by a strong shining sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe airport is quite busy on the ground. Bering Air has one of its main bases over there.  Many of the engines are covered with a special heating blanket to keep batteries and oil from freezing. Bering Air provides a wide variety of air service; you might even say extreme air service, to Alaska and beyond. It must be difficult to operate every day from Nome because of the frequency of adverse weather. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe turnaround in Nome is going to be long as we do not yet have our landing permits for Russia. We visit downtown Nome for a quick sandwich and a surrealistic walk on the iced Bering Sea. Our friend from Bering Air gave us a ride to the harbor and downtown, which turned into more of a guided tour than a lift. The main activities in Nome are king crab fishing and gold dredging. Gold mining, we learned,  was popular in this area from 1898 to 1907, when gold was found in the beach sand for dozens of miles along the coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nDowntown is quite small but lovely with its quaint fishing boats and antique gold mining prospecting equipment.  It almost gives you the feeling of being in a frozen ghost town, except the people living here are exceptionally friendly. Nature here can be so rough and the people are very pleasant and unselfish. In adverse conditions, people are more cohesive because they never know what will happen tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Embraer and Pratt & Whitney outfits attracted the attention of the locals at the sandwich shop.  Everyone asked questions about our world tour and they seemed interested in having something unusual going on today.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter lunch we walk on the frozen Bering Sea. We are surrounded by the sound of silence except for the crunch of  snow under our footsteps. Leisure activities on this enormous piece of ice include: skiing, snowmobiling and dog sled racing. During the months of November through March, you can view the Aurora Borealis, a natural light show that fills the sky with an incredible glow of green and white colors. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe just got the call from Renault from Speedwings.  The Russian permit is now approved. \\r\\n\\r\\nCustoms in Magadan may have a delay and during that period we might not be allowed to disembark the plane for four hours. We hope to be lucky.\"}}}',NULL,'2018-01-15 18:30:38','2018-03-29 16:05:31'),(909,908,'[\"en\"]','2017-03-27 19:43:00',0,'{\"date\": \"27/03/2017 19:43\", \"role\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Pilot\"}}, \"image\": {\"url\": \"https://daflwcl3bnxyt.cloudfront.net/m/7fc26ccb33b90206/original/06.jpg\", \"bynderId\": \"12E979D3-7373-4CAE-924D2888E6E9271A\"}, \"title\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Day Two: The Place of Many Fish\"}}, \"author\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Nicolas Barbé\"}}, \"avatar\": {\"url\": \"\", \"bynderId\": \"\"}, \"content\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Second day of our journey: Keflavik, Iceland to Iqaluit, Canada\\r\\nFlight time 03:16 BIKF-CYFB: (Keflavik-Iqaluit)  \\r\\nDistance: 1,206 nm\\r\\nLeg 1\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a thoroughly nice meal in Keflavik, at Iceland’s famous Kaffi Duus, we are especially enthusiastic about what is going to happen next. The world tour is really taking shape now.  Serious things will start as we begin to encounter inhospitable areas during our flights. Rest will be a valuable resource for the journey ahead. The night was short but especially nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday we are flying three legs with two fuel stops. It will probably be the longest day of this adventure, more than 10 hours. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe have great weather for the flight from Iceland to Canada. There is a lot of sun but below freezing temperatures. We were worried in Keflavik about the cold atmosphere because aircraft don\'t like extreme weather. Too much cold is dangerous for the engine as well as external components such as tires, flight controls, and paint.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the outside temperature reaches below -10 degrees Celsius, it is time to think about solutions to take care of the batteries and the avionic suite. When temperatures fall to -20 degrees Celsius, it is a common practice to leave the airplane in a hangar overnight and use hot air to heat the cabin and the batteries. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrival to Iqaluit is quite impressive. Today we have unlimited visibility, no wind, beautiful sunshine and a climate of -30 degrees Celsius. The landscape is breathtaking: rolling hills, glacial landscapes and tundra. It will be hard for us to leave, but we have less than an hour here to plug in the GPU and charge the batteries.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe frigid weather gives you a weird feeling.  When you take a deep breath, it feels like your nose is freezing (at -30 Celsius, it probably is)! Gloves are mandatory for checking the brakes and refueling. The ground is so cold and full of ice that the chocks are useless. The only solution is to put in the chocks and a parking brake with someone standing next to the plane.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilippe and Patrick managed to get something warm to eat in town. They came back with a picture of a stop sign in three languages: English, French and Inuktitut, which are all the official languages of Iqaluit. The Inuktitut (native Eskimo-Aleut language) writing is beautiful. In Inuktitut, “Iqaluit” means “the place of many fish”; this relates to the fishing activity in Frobisher Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a small sample of Inuktitut: ᓈᒻᒪᒃᑦᓯᐊᕆᑦ , meaning, “Have a good journey!” The three of us need to improve our pronunciation a little bit! (Naammaktsiarit). \\r\\n\\r\\nMany thanks to the kind handling agents helping us outside despite the cold weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Passage to the North\\r\\nCYFB-CYZF: (Iqaluit, Canada - Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada) \\r\\nFLT: 03:23 \\r\\nDistance 1,275 nm\\r\\nLeg 2\\r\\n\\r\\nOur departure from Iqaluit led us to a very northern track. We are almost tangent to the 65° parallel northwest of Coral Harbour, close to the Arctic Circle, before entering the Northwest Territories. Snow and ice are everywhere below the wings. We are flying over an ocean of white colors.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the flight, most of the time our G1000 delivers the following message when looking for the nearest airport window: “none within 200 nm. Inhospitable areas.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather in Yellowknife is not as cold as it was in Iqaluit. The average temperature is around -7° Celsius. Philippe noticed a lot of snow on the ground and low clouds in the air during our approach. Once on the ground, the activity on the airfield is quite impressive; there are a lot of regional jets, turboprops, pistons taking off and landing on both runways. The apron is covered by at least 15 centimeters of fresh snow. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phenom 300, with its hot Brazilian blood, prefers warmer places. The aircraft is very hard to maneuver due to the slippery apron and the snow. We make a 180 degree turn by pushing on the tip of the wing’s leading edge; this is a fantastically cool feature on the Phenom 300.  Thanks to Patrick, we managed to do it with ease under the snow. \\r\\n\\r\\nA fun fact: during the last week of March in Yellowknife, there is a Caribou Carnival that celebrates the end of winter with a variety of activities held on the still frozen Frame Lake. \\r\\n\\r\\nYellowknife is also known as the main base of the family-run Buffalo Airways and the famous Joe McBryan (aka \\\"Buffalo Joe\\\"). This airline is the subject of a reality TV show, “Ice Pilots NWT.”  Before our departure, one of their company planes had overflown our Phenom 300.  Their company motto: \\\"Your passage to the North\\\" became \\\"Our passage to the North!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWarm Welcome in Cool Alaska\\r\\nCYZF-PANC: (Yellowknife, Northwest Territories – Anchorage, Alaska)\\r\\nFLT: 02:55 \\r\\nDistance: 1,055 nm\\r\\nLeg 3\\r\\n\\r\\nWe leave the Northwest Territories for Alaska. The routine is typical for this day: takeoff weights, landing weights, cruising levels, fuel consumption, speeds are all almost the same for the three legs. The landscape is white and blue and is so beautiful and peaceful. We are a world apart from our daily European operation. Approaching Alaska, we cross north of the Rocky Mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnchorage is a busy airport and traffic is more international than in Yellowknife. We were in Instrument Meteorological Conditions up to 6000 feet; then the visibility was better.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe had a warm welcome in Anchorage with the great team who were most helpful. The weather is not too extreme, so our Colibri can stay outside tonight. By the time we arrive into Anchorage, we are all quite exhausted. We will also have to work on re-routing our schedule since we found out there is fuel shortage in Anadyr, Russia, tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have three options:\\r\\n1) PANC-PAOM (Anchorage-Nome) and then PAOM-UHMM (Magadan Russia).\\r\\n2) PASY-RJCC ( Shemya Eareckson AS) to Sapporo.\\r\\n3) PADK-RJCC (Adam Airport) to Sapporo.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter careful consideration, we have decided that option one is the best. After such a long day we are all extremely exhausted and the final decision will be made tomorrow. I am so tired tonight, I almost fell asleep during dinner.

The departure from France’s Le Bourget airport was almost on schedule, just 25 minutes of delay after adjusting our last details. There was a lot of excitement in the Parisian air today as we readied our Colibri and the crew for our first complete world tour from the west. \\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody worked really hard to get everything set for this great adventure. (The proposed schedule still needs a little fine tuning, especially on the leg from Alaska to Japan via Russia. More on that later).  Thanks to Embraer and Pratt & Whitney Canada for providing us with a special set of spare parts to use in case of failure. The best thing to do with an AOG (Aircraft on Ground) kit is to never have to use it. \\r\\n\\r\\nJean-Noël from Pratt and Whitney was here to bid us a bon voyage. He works as a field support representative and our friends from Embraer were not far away either; with Embraer Executive Jet Services really close to our departure stand. Tim Epping, the Customer Support Representative from Embraer, wished us a safe trip to Iceland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flight today was especially nice. The departure from Paris on an easterly heading was confining us at 3000 feet for a while due to Paris’s Charles de Gaulle flight traffic. We then had a step takeoff: FL 100 to 190 to 240 and at last FL430. The final cruising altitude was reached fifty minutes after takeoff due to ATC restriction. At FL 430 and ISA, an engine needs 203 kgs each of JET-A1 per hour to obtain 434 KTAS.  PW535E engines are almost anorexic but they give you an athlete’s speed and power.\\r\\n\\r\\nEn route, the weather was perfect as oceanic clearance was received over Scotland. I was a little rusty with my oceanic organization. To be honest, HF communications are not an easy task and I take my hat off to Philippe and his ability to understand the non-understandable! HF communications are similar to black magic; sometimes you can even discover a new language. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe approach over Iceland was idyllic, the weather was perfect, and the sun gave off a very nice light. The beauty of this country is really amazing and uncommon. Here you see snow, ice cliffs, glaciers, craggy lava formations, the sea, really dark lands, mossy hills and steaming fumaroles. \\r\\n\\r\\nA couple of minutes after landing, there was a weird smell that we were able to distinguish in the flight deck, something a little bit acrid. We realized during the final approach that yellow sulfur smoke was on our path.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrival in Reykjavik was magnificent and the landscapes here are surreal.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was not a big flying day, but changing the daily routine for the crew and setting everything up for this unusual long-haul adventure is not an easy task.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are now on the track to give you day by day news and stories from our great adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything is set for tomorrow, it will be quite a long day; our dispatch office from Speedwings has done a great job today.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave fun and fly safe.\"}}}',NULL,'2018-01-15 19:46:15','2018-03-29 16:05:31'),(9011,908,'[\"en\"]','2016-11-04 19:46:00',0,'{\"date\": \"04/11/2016 19:46\", \"role\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Pilot\"}}, \"image\": {\"url\": \"\", \"bynderId\": \"\"}, \"title\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"The last days of a great adventure\"}}, \"author\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Nicolas Barbé\"}}, \"avatar\": {\"url\": \"\", \"bynderId\": \"\"}, \"content\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"​As I mentioned in our last post, we were going to perform an airway marathon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was exactly the case.

I am surprised by landscapes under our wings -- sometimes arid and sometimes really green. Colors are constantly changing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe operation over Gulf of Guinea was really intense; the workload was high enough to keep Philippe and I really busy. The equator crossing was not even noticed as the atmosphere in the cockpit was serious.  At FL430, we met some CBs, which we had to avoid visually from time to time. Tropopause altitude can be really high at such latitudes. You can expect to get high convective activity up to FL600 and temperatures flirting sometimes well below -70 degrees static. (The maximum authorized limit for the Phenom 300 at FL 450 is -70 degrees Celsius of SAT). As the flights increased, nights for Philippe and I were really \\\"sleepy.\\\" We are now used to each other, and as a constituted crew, each of us knows exactly what to do regarding the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stops over Pointe Noire, Abidjan and Laayoune were really efficient.

The city has a warm, summer Mediterranean climate with mild, moderately wet winters and dry, warm summers.\\r\\n\\r\\nCape Town looks like a European capital at the geographical end of the world. The atmosphere is really nice and it is a really good place to live.  People from a lot of different horizons and nationalities live there together in relatively good harmony. The city has museums, aquariums, architecture, sports and so on – everything is there to make you feel happy. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most exciting places to visit is Table Mountain National Park. Table Mountain is one of the New 7 Wonders of Nature. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main feature of Table Mountain is the level plateau approximately 3 kilometers from side to side, edged by impressive cliffs. It is so nice to breathe pure air up there while going for a walk or a hike. There are several circuits, from very easy to medium, but make sure you have a good pair of shoes. \\r\\n\\r\\nA very impressive thing when you are standing at an altitude of 1,084 meters is the sounds you hear from the city, which produces a constant roaring. I recommend walking above this altitude. But be careful, don\'t lose your cable car ticket or you will have to walk another two and a half hours  to reach the bus stop.  Sometimes you can walk into clouds at the top of this mountain. This cloud formation is called the \\\"tablecloth.\\\" Legend attributes this phenomenon to a smoking contest between the devil and a local pirate called Van Hunks. In fact, this orographic cloud is formed when a southeasterly wind is directed up the mountain\'s slopes into colder air. \\r\\n\\r\\nFarther south, you will be able to find the Cape of Good Hope, which was once believed to be the dividing point between the Atlantic and Indian oceans. In fact, the southernmost point of the African continent  is Cape Agulhas, about 150 kilometers to the east-southeast. By tradition, Cape of Good Hope  is considered as this peculiar place where the two oceans rejoining. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom  a romantic and poetic point of view, Cape of Good Hope is still considered as this  converging point.\\r\\n\\r\\nFauna and flora are really rich in this part of South Africa. So many diverse species – penguins, whales, seals, fish, ostriches, baboons and so on. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring our visit to Cape of Good Hope, we were able to see a beached whale. The whale was there for two days and tourists were very enthusiastic about it until the middle of the day, when the smell produced by the combination of the really hot air and the washed-up whale became stronger.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had more fun observing the penguins playing with the little shore waves. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis morning, we headed back to the FBO to start our Northern African marathon. Cape Town to Paris via four stops and two overnights. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first stop of the day was in Windhoek, Namibia. A very dynamic airport.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn less than a month, three new operators have started to schedule flights to Windhoek. Qatar and Air Ethiopia have been flying there for a month now, and today was the inaugural flight of the Amsterdam junction, with an A330 from KLM with a lot of officials, journalists, photographers and African dancers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 4,000-meter- long runaway is really important, especially when you check the LFE (field elevation) at almost 6,000 feet, where the temperature reached 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees) easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow weird, on the aft fuselage of the A330, you can read \\\"The Flying Dutchman.\\\" That was the name of the frequent flyer program before the creation of Air France’s Flying Blue, but it is also known as a legendary ghost ship that can never make port and is doomed to sail the oceans forever. The myth is likely to have originated from the 17th-century, when a Dutchman came to the Cape in distress from bad weather and wanted to get into the harbor but could not get a pilot to conduct her and was lost at sea. Ever since then, her vision appears in very bad weather.\\r\\n\\r\\nHopefully, no ghosts and very good weather en route to Pointe-Noire, which is the second largest city in the Republic of Congo, after the capital of Brazzaville. Pointe-Noire is the main commercial center of the country and is essentially the center of the oil industry in the Republic of Congo, one of the main oil producers in Central Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were delighted with a fantastic visual approach for RWY 17. Aircraft parked, covered and refueled for our next trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo happy to have some sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee you tomorrow.​\"}}}',NULL,'2018-01-15 19:48:48','2018-03-29 16:05:31'),(9013,908,'[\"en\"]','2016-10-27 19:49:00',0,'{\"date\": \"27/10/2016 19:49\", \"role\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Pilot\"}}, \"image\": {\"url\": \"https://daflwcl3bnxyt.cloudfront.net/m/50e9614e0d4c38e7/original/09.jpg\", \"bynderId\": \"18A37530-03B5-4BD5-BC68EC99C0452A71\"}, \"title\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"On our way to South Africa\"}}, \"author\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Nicolas Barbé\"}}, \"avatar\": {\"url\": \"\", \"bynderId\": \"\"}, \"content\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"​Yesterday\'s flight was: FVFA-FACT\\r\\nBlock time: 03:05\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent the night in Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe. This place, which all of us have visited, is always great. After yesterday\'s trip, we decided to go straight to our accommodation for a good night of sleep. Toads and monkeys broke the silence of Zimbabwe\'s night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following morning, we walked to the Falls. The temperature at 10:30 LT (08:30 STD) was almost 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit). The sun was really strong! Once again, my skin looked like vanilla-strawberry ice cream!  But the difficulty of this 10-minute walk was forgotten once in front of the Falls!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waterfalls, even during the dry season, are huge! They look like several sheets of water separated by big basalt plateaus. The entire volume of the Zambezi River pours through several gorges! The sound produced by the Falls is really loud, and water spray cools the surrounding area. It is a real wonder, and I imagine how impressive it might be during the rainy season or the river\'s annual flood! Around the Falls, everything is really green and rich! Monkeys are playing everywhere under the shade of trees sprayed continuously by the Zambezi water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe indigenous people living in the area surrounding Victoria Falls, the Tokaleya, named it in the Tonga language, the Mosi-oa-Tunya. That means: The smoke that thunders. The width of the waterfall is 1,708 meters and the height is 108 meters. In height and width, it is rivaled only by Argentina and Brazil\'s Iguazu Falls. It is really spectacular!\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter spending a couple of hours at the Falls, it was time to return to the hotel to prepare ourselves to leave Zimbabwe for South Africa! Our cameras are full of nice pictures! After a 30-minute drive, we arrived at the international airport of Victoria Falls. The building is really new. Last renovations of the airport were done less than a year ago!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building looked really good! Once again, our handling agents did not seem really familiar with private flights, but as in Tanzania, they were efficient. Customs, fuel, preflight and baggage scanning were done in a very reasonable time frame under the strong sun of Zimbabwe! We took off on RWY 12 (more than 13,000 feet long). The airfield elevation was 3,500 feet and the temperature was almost 40 degrees Celsius. But the aircraft acceleration was still good! Twenty minutes after takeoff, we reached BONAL almost at our requested flight level (FL 430). This waypoint is the exit point of Zimbabwe airspace at the border with Botswana. Later, the airway UT916 led us over the Makgadikgadi Pan. This salt pan is in the middle of the dry savanna of northeastern Botswana and is one of the largest salt flats in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe left Botswana at UDLUM waypoint to enter the South African airspace. The arrival at FACT (Cape Town International Airport) was beautiful. The light was nice and clouds were covering the top of Table Mountain! We landed after the ILS Z on RWY 19, the temperature on ground was 20 degrees Celsius and the wind was quite strong, up to 30 knots in gusts. Infrastructures at FACT are like those in Europe, and procedures looked really familiar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will spend three days there. Since our Paris departure, we have flown only in a southern direction for almost 6,500 NM airway distance. While we were in Victoria Falls, I saw a painting in front of a hotel that represented the weekly journey of the Solent, a passenger flying boat,  that began service in the 1940s. The routing was similar to the one we have used: Southampton-Augusta-Alexandria-Khartoum-Port Bell-Victoria Falls-Johannesburg. I cannot imagine how demanding it was in 1948 to perform such a trip.\\r\\nIt has changed nowadays with the Phenom and technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext time we will use the N344PL, it will be on a northern direction on the western side of Africa on our way back to Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adventure continues.\"}}}',NULL,'2018-01-15 19:50:59','2018-03-29 16:05:31'),(9014,908,'[\"en\"]','2016-10-26 19:51:00',0,'{\"date\": \"26/10/2016 19:51\", \"role\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Pilot\"}}, \"image\": {\"url\": \"https://daflwcl3bnxyt.cloudfront.net/m/544d3a1e7b1101e2/original/11.jpg\", \"bynderId\": \"66164D8C-B83C-4C53-BF28FD9D321BC3BC\"}, \"title\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"The Journey to Victoria Falls\"}}, \"author\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Nicolas Barbé\"}}, \"avatar\": {\"url\": \"\", \"bynderId\": \"\"}, \"content\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Today, we left our base camp in the Serengeti reserve with our bush guide, Jeremiah, and departed Tanzania for Zimbabwe. We were pretty sad because this place was so nice and the Tanzanians were so kind. We will miss them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe headed to Sasakwa airstrip for a 45-minutes flight on a bush airplane to Lake Manyara Airport. The turnaround was really quick, something like five minutes. Only two passengers left the single-engine turbine aircraft on the Lake Manyara stop. The next leg was a little bit shorter, 15 minutes to HTKJ (Kilimanjaro International Airport), where our vessel was waiting for us on the general aviation apron.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wings of our aircraft were covered by an orange dust. Fortunately, we had used our nose and windshield covers, which look like big camo-green socks, to protect all sensitive areas such as the pitot tubes, static covers and windshield. This protective covering is really nice, especially when you are in remote areas, as the traditional silver sunscreen is not sufficient. You need something to protect the aircraft from ultraviolet rays. Our ramp agent, Joshua, from Swissport Dar es Salam, arranged everything in an efficient and smooth way; Tanzanians are so helpful. Joshua is always smiling, always happy to help. Despite that, the security check was a little bit complicated. They are not really used to dealing with private flights and things sometimes take longer than expected. Fuel was uplifted and passengers were on the way to the aircraft. Preflight was also done, and we were ready for our departure. Along  the runway edges, some little dust tornados were starting to grow right in front of our path for departure. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe took off from RWY 09 at an elevation altitude of 2,900 feet and +31 degrees Celsius. No problem for a Phenom 300, climb performances remind you of the 3,360 pounds of thrust produced by the PW535-E jet engines. As usual, no radio contact up to FL 320, and then the communications were really weak and broken. The squawk was never obtained from ATC, and we decided to set 2000 with our mode S transponder. We have never been requested by controllers to change it on a 1200 NM airway distance flight. It\'s funny, because we are not really used to this in Europe. Radar coverage is sometimes so sharp that we have to change squawk two or three times on a Le Bourget to Milan Linate flight. The feeling of being alone is omnipresent over Tanzania and Zambia.\\r\\n\\r\\nFL 430 Mach 0.74 and OAT displays -64 degrees Celsius. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs usual, everything is quiet, with only the communications from Zambia reminding us of human existence. After almost 3:00 of flight time, we were able to see a B337-8 from Springbok (This is the call sign for South African airways.), 10 NM west of our position. I prefer to observe Springboks on a Safari photo trip! Later in the day, after the debrief, Willy, our operations support, confirmed that only two aircraft were present over the Zambian sky! Zambia is bigger in area than France – 752,628 km<sup>2</sup> for Zambia versus 543,965 square Km<sup>2</sup> for France! Try to imagine how alone you are here.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilippe and I were really excited to overfly Victoria Falls, not only for the arrival needs but for sightseeing. It can be tricky to try to perform 360 degrees at FL 070 at the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia for our passengers’ and our own pleasure! As you might know, in a calm sea, every man is a pilot. Let\'s try it. In the worst-case scenario, ATC will refuse it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to the great Livingstone approach controller who was so helpful to us. He gave us the full procedure to achieve our trick with the air-to-air frequency used by tourism aircraft performing sightseeing flights overhead Victoria Falls. The only concern of the ATC was the fact we were considered a medium aircraft for the wake turbulence, but he was more relaxed when we advised him that we were less than eight tons of total weight! The view was unbelievable!!! The Falls are so impressive! What a great moment. After our little excursion off track, Philippe ended the flight via a well-managed visual approach for the 13,123-feet-long runway 12 at Victoria Falls airport. Tomorrow morning, we will go to the Falls. We will experience another magical moment, which we have been experiencing since our departure from Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new horizon for tomorrow after the Falls will be Cape Town in South Africa!

The park’s name comes from a word used by the Massai to describe the area -- \\\"siringet,\\\" which means \\\"The place where the land runs on forever.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is so true. It seems there is no world outside this park, which covers almost 5,700 square miles. All this land is covered mainly by wildebeest and other animals, which are now making their annual migration based upon this year’s rainfall patterns. Due to global warming, locals advised us, things are seriously changing and it has an impact on the wildlife in such remote areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best place to observe this migration is from the sky! So Philippe had a great idea about taking a hot air balloon safari at sunrise. Still a little bit sleepy, everybody jumped into the four-wheel drive to the takeoff spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were welcomed by our captain, Mohamed Masud, a highly experienced hot air balloon pilot with roughly 2,500 hours of flight time during the last 15 years. It was a brand new experience for everyone. Safety briefing, weather report and now let’s go where the wind blows!The takeoff was really amazing, as we all sat inside this big wicker basket, like an astronaut in a spaceship preparing for departure. The hot air produced by the burner expanded into the balloon and we rose slowly at 100 feet per minute. The balloon started out slowly dragging, and then we were airborne in less than 30 seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe altitude varies depending on what you want to see.  Above this infinite natural reserve, silence once again seemed to be omnipresent. Our balloon’s average cruising speed was between 12 knots near the surface and 20 knots a little bit higher. The maximum altitude on this flight was around 5,500 feet AMSL. Such values are far from our daily parameters when flying the Phenom, but Philippe and I were unanimous: \\\"As long as we are flying, we are happy!!!\\\"\\r\\n \\r\\nWildlife and aerology knowledge were perfectly mastered by Captain Mohamed. Once again, giraffes, buffaloes and gnus were present for our great pleasure. After a one-hour ride, it was time to land in Tanzania. Mohamed started to release the hot air from the top of the balloon. He performed a really nice landing and the basket did not tip over. We shared a glass of champagne on the landing site! (What a surrealistic experience to drink a cold glass of champagne in the middle of this Serengeti reserve among gnus and other wild animals!). As explained by Captain Mohamed, it is a tradition to drink champagne when you land in a hot air balloon. The tradition originated with the first balloon flights when pilots were unable to control the path of the balloon upon landing, often damaging farm fields. To prevent anger and aggressiveness from farmers, pilots decided to offer them champagne.\\r\\n\\r\\nMohamed was also really proud to have a group of French on this flight, reminding us that the first manned balloon flight, which took place on October 15, 1783, was piloted by a Frenchman named Pilâtre de Rozier. That was almost exactly 233 years ago. The magic was still there all these years later and we were delighted to have had such a nice experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nTomorrow is our departure for Zimbabwe! Everything is ready. Our Speedwings Jet Executive GmbH team from Geneva has once again well managed our day trip. A big thanks also to Fanny from World Fuel Services, who has made our fuel delivery easier.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am now impatient to reach new horizons.\"}}}',NULL,'2018-01-15 19:53:27','2018-03-29 16:05:31'),(9016,908,'[\"en\"]','2016-10-23 19:53:00',0,'{\"date\": \"23/10/2016 19:53\", \"role\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Pilot\"}}, \"image\": {\"url\": \"https://daflwcl3bnxyt.cloudfront.net/m/37b521a046482947/original/12.jpg\", \"bynderId\": \"CC383A70-17F9-430A-BFA258C08953EE77\"}, \"title\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Beautiful Safari\"}}, \"author\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Nicolas Barbé\"}}, \"avatar\": {\"url\": \"\", \"bynderId\": \"\"}, \"content\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"After two days of our journey and our fourth stop, we will finally reach Kilimanjaro.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe spent the night in Arusha.

Airstrips are not part of the daily routine of Embraer planes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flight was really nice, the air was smooth and still.

As far as I can remember, the Outside Air Temperature reading at FL 085 was 14 degrees Celsius.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be honest, it was even a little bit too cold in the bush airplane,  especially on the second leg, which took roughly 50 minutes of flight time because we had to make  a stop for other passengers going into another wild reserve. As I was tired, I fell asleep. Philippe sat in the right seat next to the pilot, so everything was under control, except for the buffaloes or gnus herd wandering on the Grumeti Airstrip as we were established on short final and fully configured for landing. The pilot had to perform a go-around due to wild animals crossing the runway.

Cairo is a big international airport with three very long parallel runways. It is like Europe but there is no more CFMUs ( Central Flow Management Units).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were not expecting any surprises on our departure. FPL was filed and acknowledged by Egyptian services, everything was checked and briefed the day before by Speedwings Executive Jet GmbH, our operation provider. So on that lovely Morning in Cairo everything was fine, we were perfectly on time, one engine running for our convenience. I asked the start up on delivery clearance and the ATC was really surprised! \\\"N344PL I do confirm we do not have your FPL!!\\\" After 35\' trying to find a solution with our ops in Geneva and the local ATC we managed to start the taxi.\\r\\n\\r\\nTakeoff from Cairo with at least 01:00 of delay and we were now towards Khartoum FIR. The track was pretty simple all along the Red Sea to Djibouti. Philippe is an adventurer and he knows pretty well all the Phraseology subtlety: HF, primary and secondary frequency or IFBP on 126.9.\\r\\n\\r\\nIFBP (in flight broadcast procedure is peculiar), you have to make a position report roughly every 10\' or when crossing an airway and you can spend a long time trying desperately to hear a familiar voice to guide you over the immensity of Africa. This is a really remote area and I was glad about Philippe\'s experience in this region and his pedagogy to show me the trick! The SLOP procedure was also mandatory in this part of Africa. You have to make a track offset of 1 or 2 NM on the right for spacing reasons between all traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flight was long, but I have noticed when you perform a flight in the European area from Corfu to Brussels it seems to be an eternity, even if landscapes are great, but here, it is Africa, the workload was so high with ATC and overfly permit management that for us this almost 04:00 of block time seems to last a couple of intense minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverfly Permit!!! Thanks again to our ants from Switzerland, I am talking about Willy and Renaud, they are able to follow us on real time with a little GPS tracker even in remote areas! The satcom was so useful to gather information such as the acknowledgment of the overflight permit send 2 months ago via email.\\r\\n\\r\\nLanding in Djibouti was nice and the sandwich meal brake was a delight for all of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nFuel uplift with our friendly handler from Djibouti and chocks removal and we are taking off to Kilimandjaro! Now it is show time - we will cross the equator - my first! And we will play with the ITCZ (inter tropical convergence zone) this is an area where weather phenomena can be really tough! You can expect CB\'s up to FL 530 and even higher with very low SAT temperature, ice crystals and other cool stuff that pilots don\'t like... But for the Phenom, no problem, a good flight preparation, fuel and a good radar are the best tools to feel comfortable in such regions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrival in Tanzania after Kenya\\r\\n\\r\\nTanzania with Mont Kilimandjaro as landscape - what an amazing view! We landed on Runway 09 in HTKJ with a beautiful sunset. Thanks to our Egyptian delay the magic of our arrival was even better then forecasted.

The atmosphere in Paris was really nice, and everybody in Paris was really hyped about this first day of our marvelous trip around Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Epping and Sebastien Abouly have managed a great departure for us, with N344PL parked next to his brother, the Legacy 450. The weather was a little bit cold and cloudy, but smiles on everybody\'s faces reminded us how warm the journey would be.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter half an hour of talking around those two great aircraft, it was time to request our startup for our first turnaround in Italy. Weather was really nice, engines and aircraft were running smoothly at FL450, our ground speed was around 450 KTAS with almost a 40 kts tailwind component all the way toward south Italy. \\r\\n\\r\\nA few minutes after takeoff, we were heading east above the cloud layer, with our faces fully exposed to the nice, warm sun filtered via our windshield. There was a little bit of light chops above the Alps, as usual in this area, and our cabin was quiet as passengers were just recovering from the early wake-up.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe landed in Taranto for a fuel stop and a quick meal of delicious sandwiches, baguette and French pastries. After a 90-minute lunch break, we resumed our trip toward North Africa. Flying at FL450 above the clouds, we were not able to contemplate the beauty of the Mediterranean Sea. Philippe and I were discussing our different flight experiences and most of the time discussions were diverting to the great qualities of the Phenom 300.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilippe\'s kids are really enthusiastic about our trip; they simply don\'t know where we are going. It is a surprise, and they try by any means to find our final destinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you might expect, we were often trying to give them clues about destinations and sometimes joking about the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrival in Cairo was really cool and soft. We landed on RWY 05C after an ILS performed in a light desert haze and a yellowish mist with a little bit of ocher sand dust everywhere.

That broad experience made him a valuable addition to Embraer Executive Jets’ new production team.  “Embraer was looking for people with a heavy aviation background so they could help train others when the company opened. We trained on the airplanes in Brazil since we didn’t have them here yet. I did well there, so I helped train other guys who are still here now.” \\r\\n\\r\\nTremain said the assembly-line processes at Embraer ensure the business jets meet the highest safety and quality standards. “I see aircraft take the first flight and come back with minimal discrepancies, so that’s a testament itself to the quality we put inside the aircraft.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is thrilled to be part of the dedicated production team that is rethinking convention at Embraer. “I’m very proud to work here with a company that can create, produce and design aircraft, moreso than anyone in the industry.

He spent most of those years in Boeing’s  C-17 program in Long Beach, California, in such positions as an aviation mechanic, manufacturing analyst and supervisor. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter working as a team leader with Embraer for about a year, Jay was promoted to production supervisor, leading the newly created second shift.  Another second-shift supervisor was added last year, and together the two now oversee about 125 workers.  “For second shift, I’m their voice pretty much. The guys know what they’re doing … My functionality is to help them get what they need to build these aircraft.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production-line processes at Embraer ensure every jet is built correctly to the highest standards, Jay said. “We have electronic capabilities to access the work orders – all electronic, no paper. In there, they can also access their technical standards. They take laptops in the plane and they build per print.  If an issue arises, a line worker reports it to their lead and then to their manufacturing engineer  “and we make sure we’re building it properly.”\\r\\nJay doesn’t hesitate to declare why Embraer is a fantastic place to work. “The people, the culture. Our people are what make us fly.

I imagine that many other pilots endure their own painstaking habits and rituals before pulling chocks on similarly elaborate missions. In my case, the next day’s events haunt every dark corner of my hotel room. My eyes burst open from restless sleep at the slightest sound, and thoughts immediately begin racing through my mind – did I miss the wake-up call? No, thank goodness. But what does the weather look like outside? Will we be able to take off? And what about the weather at our destination – will we have to be rerouted? What about our flight plans? Did I file everything correctly?...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday, though, the sun rose on a cool and partly cloudy morning in London. The plan was to fly from there to Teterboro where we would deliver three of our passengers, and then to depart for Naples, Florida, where the remaining few would deplane and bid us a final farewell. All paperwork filed accordingly, all passengers accounted for, and clear skies on the eastern coast of the U.S. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince we always try to surprise our principal, we decided to try something novel to celebrate the last day of our travels. We cooked a rack of lamb in our convection oven and served it with equally impressive accompaniments. The meal was considered a huge success by our passengers, especially complemented by the decadent pastries that we had procured in London and served for dessert. Taking our passengers into consideration is our priority, of course. So, once they had expressed their awe and gratitude, the Crew and I were assured that the remainder of our voyage would be a success. \\r\\n\\r\\nUp in the clouds, my anxious mind quieted, we crossed the Atlantic at 40,000 feet destined for home. Peaceful reflection surfaced memories from our trip, which once seemed so long but now seemed to have come and gone in the blink of an eye. My uniform could just about fly the airplane by itself, I swear, so we took turns strolling through the spacious cabin zones to stretch our legs. We kept lively conversation going, raided the galley for snacks, and marveled at the successful mission we were about to complete. \\r\\n\\r\\nToday, after a full night of sleep in my own bed, the appreciation I have for these past few weeks is overwhelming, and indescribable.

Having the flexibility to live on your own schedule is rare, especially in the sky, but our aircraft never limits the way that our principals live their busy lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, our team prepares for every flight by planning a thematic value to add to the experience, no matter how short the flight may be. Everything from catering to decorations is tailored to that theme, whether it relates to destinations, seasons, or just an idea that we decided to explore.  Once the theme is chosen, we are constantly amazed to watch Sim, our In-Flight Concierge pull decorations out of storage and set the stage.

Behind these beautiful closed doors, we prepare meals discreetly, utilize the Crew bathroom... we even use this area to simply stretch and talk, never interfering with the passengers\' flight experience.

However, among the most valuable lessons I’ve learned is the true importance of cultivating and nurturing an effective team.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many ways, building an exceptional team is much like building an exceptional aircraft. It requires precision, innovative engineering, strategic guidance and a lot of hard work. But along with minding the mechanical aspects, you must also take careful consideration of the human element before your ideas can take flight. After all, what is a great aircraft without a great crew?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, I am sharing with you a few tried and true tips – from my personal experience over the years - to get your team mission ready:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\tBe the glue.\\r\\nTeamwork, on its most fundamental level, is based on trust. And as a leader, it all starts with you. First and foremost, you must establish a bond of trust that permeates throughout your organization. There are many ways to accomplish this, but the best place to start is also the easiest and most direct: Share a clear vision of where you want to take the team, and unify them by communicating your collective mission. Transparent leadership underscored by a common goal provides a solid foundation for teamwork.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\tDevelop a rallying cry.\\r\\nOnce you’ve pointed your team in the right direction, give them something to shout about. Balance out the effort that is driven toward accomplishing objectives with a healthy dose of fun. Celebrate milestones that have been achieved. Generate excitement. Be creative. One of my favorite tactics is to create a theme – something that not only makes the vision tangible, but also acts as a lightning rod for motivation and inspiration throughout the year. This brings everyone together and engages them by focusing their efforts in a fun and interesting way.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\tWalk the talk.\\r\\nIf you want to get the most out of a team or an individual person, you have to be visible. Present. Physically involved. The team needs to see you engaged in an authentic way. I’ve had a lot of success simply by making sure that I don’t just say, “Go. Do.” I go out of my way to “do with.” It’s important to show that you are willing to get your hands dirty, roll up your sleeves and be a part of the group.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.\\tHand over the controls.\\r\\nEmpowerment is everything. Employees want to feel like they can run, but oftentimes companies or individuals will end up limiting a team’s potential instead of unleashing it. I like to promote empowerment by delegating decision-making to the team and, thus, making them an active part of the solution, all to allow the best work to come out of the group. When leaders trust and support their people, it creates an opportunity-rich environment for teams to flourish.\\r\\n\\r\\n5.\\tSay two simple words.\\r\\n“Thank you.” Say it loudly. Say it freely. Say it sincerely. And often. Trust me, it will truly make a world of difference.\\r\\n\"}}}',NULL,'2018-05-07 12:22:26',NULL),(9048,905,'[\"en\"]','2018-05-07 14:36:00',0,'{\"date\": \"07/05/2018 14:36\", \"role\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"President & CEO of Embraer Executive Jets\"}}, \"image\": {\"url\": \"https://daflwcl3bnxyt.cloudfront.net/m/782f3f8f20e95dc1/original/_MG_1508.jpg\", \"bynderId\": \"63172CEA-B41B-4D27-BF489597DE7A470B\"}, \"title\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Thought Leadership Article for Michael: The Paths Behind Positive Change\"}}, \"author\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Michael Amalfitano\"}}, \"avatar\": {\"url\": \"https://daflwcl3bnxyt.cloudfront.net/m/71f258b634c70d6f/original/_MG_1626.jpg\", \"bynderId\": \"64928666-D289-4705-B186130466D678A4\"}, \"content\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Conventional wisdom often warns against leading with emotion. Check your feelings at the door. Do not let emotions guide the way. Feelings have no place in the workplace. We’ve heard them all before. But bringing emotions into work is not always a negative thing; it can be a powerful tool to drive meaningful action.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my experience, a key part of promoting positive change is knowing how to lead through emotion, rather than with it. The emphasis is less about showing emotion, and more about creating a “feeling” within your team. One that captivates. Permeates. Motivates. When you create feelings in people, those feelings allow folks to have the will and the intent to say, “Ok, I’m going to change this.” Even the Greek philosopher Aristotle, in his treatise on effective persuasion, wrote about the power of awakening pathos (emotion) in people “so as to induce them to make the judgment desired.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOftentimes, organizations will attempt to impose change  usually formalizing it through institutional alignment meetings or by hiring consultants to implement a third-party framework. These methods may be lengthy, may lack traction and there is a chance they could fail to foster a strong esprit de corps. They’re not always organic. And they may not always resonate.\\r\\n\\r\\nNurturing transformative behavior begins and ends with creating a feeling, a motivating emotion that triggers people to care and take action. However, this feeling cannot be dictated; it must be cultivated. To strike the right chord, it is important to understand the needs, values and desires of your team members and then appeal to what sparks that galvanizing feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, there are countless potential emotional motivators, and each situation brings its own set of variables, such as team dynamic, intended goal and positive vs. negative influencers. Ultimately, it’s up to you to determine what works best for your team and what sentiment you want to create, but here is a sampling of “feelings” I like to draw upon that have proven quite effective.\\r\\n•\\tInspiration: People embrace change not by coercion or intimidation, but through inspiration and demonstration. Your attitudes and actions influence those of your team, so be the shining example and inspire them to emulate you.\\r\\n•\\tCamaraderie: Nothing strengthens a team quite like a shared feeling of commonality and community. Establish a genuine sense of “we’re all in this together,” and the sky is the limit. (Note that this doesn’t have to be something that is always directed by a leader; it can also be created by the team.)\\r\\n•\\tConfidence: Empowerment is everything. Many times, people don’t realize what they’re capable of until you encourage them and give them an opportunity to grow. It’s like taking care of a plant: Understand its unique characteristics, put it in the right environment that allows it to progress, provide proper nourishment (“You can do this. I have your back.”) and watch it flourish.\\r\\n•\\tPride:  A true sense of ownership and accomplishment can be one of the most satisfying feelings of all. Let people shine. Challenge them to outperform what they think is even possible. And when they do, remember that sincere recognition and appreciation go a long way.\\r\\n•\\tBelief: When it comes to building trust and assurance, experience matters. A track record of bringing past successes from one place to another adds credibility and gives people a reason to believe it can be done again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, emotion can be a great catalyst. And the ability to stir up something deep within your team and put them in the right frame of mind to affect change is one of the essential things that separates a boss from a leader. As Dwight D. Eisenhower put it, “Leadership is the art of getting someone else to do something you want done because he wants to do it.” Once you master this art, you are well on your way to being the positive change agent your organization needs. \"}}}',NULL,'2018-05-07 14:37:56','2018-05-07 14:41:08'),(9049,905,'[\"en\"]','2018-05-07 14:38:00',0,'{\"date\": \"07/05/2018 14:38\", \"role\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"President & CEO of Embraer Executive Jets\"}}, \"image\": {\"url\": \"https://daflwcl3bnxyt.cloudfront.net/m/71f258b634c70d6f/original/_MG_1626.jpg\", \"bynderId\": \"64928666-D289-4705-B186130466D678A4\"}, \"title\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"A Leader’s Guide to Mentoring Future Talent\"}}, \"author\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"Michael Amalfitano\"}}, \"avatar\": {\"url\": \"https://daflwcl3bnxyt.cloudfront.net/m/71f258b634c70d6f/original/_MG_1626.jpg\", \"bynderId\": \"64928666-D289-4705-B186130466D678A4\"}, \"content\": {\"_text\": {\"en\": \"As a leader, your role extends far beyond establishing a vision and direction for your company. You also have a responsibility to motivate and develop the individuals you lead to grow future talent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s a reason folks say ‘lead many, mentor few.’ Leading is an expectation. Mentoring, however, is an investment. You are contributing precious resources  your time, expertise and energy  to a long-term venture. It’s a serious commitment. And it’s also a privilege. So when you encounter a high-potential individual whose unique skills and qualities make them extremely rare and exceptionally valuable, you should feel compelled to take a deeper, personal interest in their continued development and growth. \\r\\n\\r\\nDo not look at this as a chore. Rather, it should be a source of inspiration and pride. Not only are you playing a major role in shaping someone’s growth and cultivating the next generation of leaders, you’re also gaining fresh new perspectives along the way to continuously improve the depth of your own leadership skill-sets. Done correctly, mentorship is a mutually rewarding experience  and it just might provide the lift you both need to truly grow. Just remember, what you do or don’t do) makes all the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some considerations when taking an up-and-coming high-potential employee under your wing.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook in the mirror. Take an honest assessment of your own attributes (strengths/experience) and then reflect on how you can tailor your approach, tactics, actions, activities, etc. to bring out the best in different types of people. It’s no longer about who you need to be as a leader, but rather what kind of leader you need to be for that person. Make sure that you’re the right one for the job and that your mentee is someone who can really benefit from what you specifically have to offer.\\r\\nOpen your door. People have to feel comfortable to approach you. It’s critical to have an air of openness, so create an environment where people know they can come to you and that their effort will be welcomed. Give them the time and the access.\\r\\nWatch your boundaries. As a mentor, the scope of your influence is broad, and you may find yourself assuming multiple roles in your mentee’s life. Just keep in mind you don’t have to be their everything. A coach, a friend, a boss, a role model, a parental figure, a spiritual advisor, a therapist, a designated driver, a life Sherpa  you may be some, but you don’t have to be all. Simply define your relationship and any applicable boundaries so you can focus on being the hero they need versus the one they want.\\r\\nGive a damn. Meaningful engagement is paramount to successful mentorship, so build a strong rapport and make your mentee feel worthwhile by having thoughtful, sincere interactions. Actively engage. Ask about their goals and life experiences. Nurture their curiosity. And, above all, take a genuine, vested interest in bringing out the best in them.\\r\\nStop, collaborate and listen. I enjoy sharing learned experiences. And while imparting wisdom is a positive, you also have to balance that with cooperative dialogue and attentive listening. That means authentically asking for their point of view, being open to what’s on their mind and working together to define the practices that enable them to thrive. The concept of mentoring has to be a two-way street, and a leader has to have the confidence to be vulnerable in order for growth to take place.\\r\\nEmpower wisely. Empowerment means the honor of responsibility  and the responsibility of accountability. You don’t want to focus just on empowerment without accountability because that can breed chaos. And you shouldn’t singularly stress accountability because that’s a detriment to empowerment. Ultimately, these are two sides of the same coin when developing a good leader.\\r\\nBe transparent. You need to be able to share information openly and willingly so people aren’t left having to figure things out on their own. It comes down to delivering a realness, a rawness. By tangibly presenting things in a transparent and informative way, you’re allowing it to be evaluated, challenged, debated and embraced. People will believe that something can truly come from it because you’re communicating in an authentic way.\\r\\nChampion respect. A healthy respect for each other’s skills and talents is like oxygen to the relationship. And respecting their journey and way of doing things  which may be different from yours  is equally as vital. By developing a mutual respect, you’ll not only establish a foundation of trust and confidence, but also build a loyalty factor.\\r\\nDo what’s uncomfortable. One of the finest expressions of respect is not praise, but rather a willingness to talk openly and honestly. A leader has to have courage to go where it’s uncomfortable: to provide honest assessments, to have tough conversations about people’s performance, to be willing to say no, etc. It’s easy to pat people on the back and tell them what they’re doing well. But oftentimes leaders avoid the difficult conversations. You have to have the fortitude to say, “I’ve also observed some behaviors that I can help you with. Let’s talk about those.” That kind of feedback is essential. Growth only comes from having the hard part of the conversation, never from just the easy part. \\r\\nCondition for excellence. Set a positive tone by expecting, recognizing and rewarding personal growth. High standards lead to even higher potential, so inspire, encourage and motivate them by demonstrating your own high standards and challenging others to achieve even more.\\r\\n\\r\\nFittingly, we have a motto at Embraer: “Challenge. Create. Outperform.” This represents our mission of taking on our customers’ challenges to create innovative solutions that help them outperform. As a leader, I like to build on this and take it a step further: I challenge myself  and everyone around me  to go beyond the limits of what’s possible and create an environment that allows our team to outperform what they ever dreamed they could be capable of. This is something I remind myself of daily, and I wholeheartedly believe if you are able to achieve even half of this, your high potentials will be able to confidently spread their wings. What’s more, you may even learn a thing or two about how to take your own leadership to new heights.\"}}}',NULL,'2018-05-07 14:39:16',NULL);

This initiative will enhance Savis and Bradar activities in the international market, working in conjunction with Rockwell Collins, and also search for existing complementary capabilities in the companies’ product lines. The first opportunity identified is the radar technology integration into the Rockwell Collins FireStorm™ system, the most precise portable solution available in the market to assure call for fire precision.
